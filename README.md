<h2>Introduction</h2>
A syntax highlighter is a software tool or feature commonly found in text editors, integrated development environments (IDEs), and code editors. Its purpose is to display source code with different colors and styles based on the language's syntax rules. This visual differentiation helps developers read and understand the code more easily by highlighting keywords, strings, comments, and other elements according to predefined rules.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
My motivation is to use it for blog posts with code parts e.g. <a href='https://nathankrasney.com/posts/load-image-faster-with-webp'>Why Should You Use The Advanced WebP Image File Format</a>

<h2>Leading questions</h2>
Seems that are two popular : <a href='https://prismjs.com/'>prism</a> and <a href='https://highlightjs.org/'>highlightjs</a> so which one to choose

<h2>package decision</h2>
Prism is lighter and faster according to the the first reference so i prefer it. it has also other benefits.
